# RDPWrap 1.6.2 + win 10 privacy

RDPWrap 1.6.2 for windows 10 home builds v18362.267 through 21370, and win10privacy to block windows updates.
UNINSTALL YOUR CURRENT RDPWRAP IF IT IS INSTALLED, REBOOT THE MACHINE BEFORE STARTING THIS.
## Setup


```css
Download the full zip and extract.
Run install.bat
Move all files from the zip into /programfiles/rdpwrap
Run autoupdate as admin
Run RDPConf.exe to verify working condition.
Right-click W10Privacy.exe and choose Run as administrator from the context menu. Choose to make a system restore point. Itâ€™s also worth making a full system backup (just in case).
Go to Extras > Windows Updates to manage the options. There are six different check boxes.
Check the first five options
Click Set changed settings
```

## Disclaimer
I took no part in either of these tools, I just verified these solutions work on the builds above.<br>
